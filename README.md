# Response Meter

A lightweight tool to continuously hit a target server, collect responses, and calculate traffic distribution percentages. It's useful for A/B testing, canary releases, or any situation where you need to verify how traffic is being routed between multiple systems.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Concurrent Load Testing**: Send multiple concurrent requests to measure traffic distribution
- ðŸ“Š **Real-time Statistics**: Live TUI dashboard showing response distribution and request rates (updates every 2 seconds)
- ðŸŽ¯ **HTTP Status Code Tracking**: Monitor and visualize HTTP status code distribution
- âš¡ **High Performance**: Built with Go for efficient concurrent request handling
- ðŸ”§ **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to support various collectors and reporters in the future
- ðŸ“¦ **Zero Dependencies**: Built using only Go's standard library - no external dependencies required

## Installation

Requires Go 1.24.2+

```bash
go install github.com/phhphc/response-meter@latest
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
response-meter -t="https://example.com" -c=10
```

### Command Line Options

- `-t string`: Target URL to test (required)
- `-c int`: Number of concurrent requests (default: 1)

### Sample Output

The tool provides a real-time TUI dashboard displaying:

## Use Cases

- Monitor traffic distribution between different versions of your application to ensure proper routing ratios.
- Verify that canary deployments are receiving the expected percentage of traffic and responding correctly.
- Test load balancer behavior and ensure traffic is being distributed as expected across backend services.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular design with three main components:

- **Meter**: Orchestrates concurrent requests and aggregates statistics
- **Collectors**: Gather data (currently supports HTTP status codes)
- **Reporters**: Display results (currently supports TUI output)

```

## Future Roadmap

The project is designed to be extensible. Planned enhancements include:

### Additional Collectors

- **Request Headers**: Collect and analyze custom response headers
- **Response Body**: Parse and categorize response body content
- **Response Time**: Measure and track request latency

### Additional Reporters

- **JSON Output**: Machine-readable output format
